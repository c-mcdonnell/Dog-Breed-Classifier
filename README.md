# Dog Breed Classifier
## Use a created Python classifier to identify dog breeds from images

The objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs and which are not of dogs.
2. For the images that *are* dogs, correctly classify their breed. 
3. Determine which CNN model architecture (image classification algorithm), **AlexNet**, **VGG**, or **ResNet**, works the "best" for classifying the images and how well it works.
4. Consider how long these tasks take and how to maximize time resources and accuracy.
